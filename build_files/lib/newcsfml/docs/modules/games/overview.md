# 📦 `Games`
#### part of [NewCSFML](../../README.md)

Provides core systems for **application lifecycle, window management, and input handling** within the framework.

> Example:
> Acts as the central runtime layer coordinating window rendering, event processing, and global game state.

## 🔹 Overview

| Submodule         | Role                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `event`           | Handles input abstraction and event utilities      |
| `keyboard`        | Handles keyboard input utilities                   |
| `game`            | Central runtime controller and system orchestrator |
| `window`          | Rendering, event polling, and element management   |
| `window_settings` | Window configuration container                     |

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This module defines the **core runtime layer** of the framework.

* Abstracts CSFML windowing and event systems
* Centralizes application lifecycle management
* Provides a structured way to manage rendering and input
* Ensures consistent ownership and resource tracking via `nsf_game_t`

It exists to **bridge low-level CSFML systems with high-level engine architecture**, enabling modular and scalable applications.

## 🔹 Architecture

### Internal Composition

```
games
├── event
├── keyboard
├── game
├── window
└── window_settings
```

### Flow

```
User → nsf_game → nsf_window → nsf_event → nsf_keyboard → CSFML
                     ↓
               Rendering / Audio / Input
```

## 🔹 Dependencies

| Module         | Usage                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `nsf_game`     | Core ownership and orchestration   |
| `nsf_systems`  | Utilities (vector, utils, etc.)    |
| `nsf_graphics` | Rendering elements (sprites, etc.) |
| `nsf_audio`    | Sound and music systems            |
| `CSFML`        | Windowing and input backend        |

---

## 🔹 Key Responsibilities

* Manage the **main application lifecycle**
* Handle **window creation, rendering, and destruction**
* Process **user input (keyboard, mouse, events)**
* Provide a **centralized runtime context (`nsf_game_t`)**
* Coordinate interactions between subsystems

**Must NOT:**

* Implement game logic
* Contain heavy rendering logic (delegated to graphics)
* Directly expose CSFML internals to users

### Subsystem APIs

| Subsystem         | Example Function               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `event`           | `nsf_event_cmp()`              |

    nsf.game.display(game);
}

nsf.game.destroy(game);
```

## 🔹 Data Flow

| Step | Action                                      |
|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Initialize `nsf_game`                       |
| 2    | Create and assign `nsf_window_settings`     |
| 3    | Create window and attach to game            |
| 4    | Enter main loop (`update → draw → display`) |
| 5    | Poll and process events via `nsf_event`     |
| 6    | Process keyboard input `nsf_keyboard`       |
| 7    | Cleanup all resources via `destroy()`       |

---

## 🔹 Design Constraints

* Strict separation between:

    * event handling
    * window management
    * game orchestration
* Must use `nsf_game_t` as the **single ownership root**
* No direct CSFML exposure outside implementation
* Must remain modular and extensible

---

## 🔹 Common Patterns

* Central loop: `update → draw → display`
* Event polling via window → processed by event module
* Resource registration through window/game
* Ownership hierarchy: `game → window → elements`

---

## 🔹 Known Limitations

* Single-window architecture (no multi-window support)
* Event system is minimal (no advanced input mapping)
* No built-in scene or state manager

---

## 🔹 Notes

* This module is the **foundation of runtime execution**
* Designed to stay minimal and focused on orchestration
* All high-level systems depend on it
* Encourages clean separation between engine and game logic

| `*_manage*.c` | Logic and transformations   |
| `*_draw.c`    | Rendering logic             |

## 🔹 Extension Guidelines

* Add new systems via `nsf_game_t` or composition
* Extend window capabilities without breaking API
* Keep event system stateless and lightweight
* Avoid coupling modules directly together
* Maintain strict API naming consistency
